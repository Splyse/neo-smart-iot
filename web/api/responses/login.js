// NOTE:
//
// We could have done all (or part) of this in our UserController's `login` action.
// In many cases, that would actually be preferable.  This example uses a "fat" custom
// response to demonstrate how you can do it, and because we only have one type of login
// anyways.
//
// For instance, if we need the backend to support multiple user roles, with different
// login behavior, we might need to send back a few different kinds of success/failure
// codes, with different messages based on the outcome.  In that case, it would be most
// sensible to create a custom version of the logic here in the relevant controller action.
// There is absolutely nothing wrong with this!  It is just as much the "Sails way" :)
//
// On the other hand, if we needed to add a new login page somewhere else on the site,
// we might need to redirect to a different URL if that login failed (e.g. /checkout/login)
// However _everything else is almost exactly the same_. In this case, we might be able to
// use the `inputs` object in this custom response to make it **just configurable enough**
// to reuse this code.  If it doesn't work out- no problem, create a custom action.  But
// if it does work, it's a great way to keep things simple and conventional.
// (This approach sound familiar?  That's because it's basically how blueprint actions work.)
//
// For this example, we'll make the assumption that our app will have the following default
// login behavior:
// • success => either send a "200 OK" response or redirect to the home page
// • bad credentials => either send a "400 Bad Request" or redirect to `/login`
// • unexpected server error => call `res.negotiate()`
//                              (see `sailsjs.org/#/documentation` for more info on what
//                               `res.negotiate()` does)
